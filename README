ZIMA is the oar-frontend wrapper that will:
 * take a message from bamboo or a developer and run oarsub many times
 * possibly have some queue status view
 * possibly have some agent status view


bamboo NPB does:
curl -s -u build:build -X POST "http://tools/bamboo/rest/api/latest/queue/MASTER-TESTPERF.json?executeAllStages&bamboo.variable.buildid=${bamboo.buildResultKey}&bamboo.variable.branch=${bamboo.repository.branch.name}"

examples:
bamboo.buildResultKey = MASTER-NPB-LINUX-670
bamboo.repository.branch.name = master


Charlie's idea of having machine characteristics boiled down into classes seems like a simplifying win
