1. "/enqueue" needs to have some way for the user to specify what tests they want to execute
 a regex on the test name?
 some kind of properties specifier? json?
 (consider multiple endpoints, eg. enqueue-regex, for different methods of this specification)

2. wire in some way to make some jobs hi-pri

3. need to keep in mind the developer just wants a machine use-case
  in OAR, an interactive job? how do they connect?

4. need to make a build/bld wrapper for these things
